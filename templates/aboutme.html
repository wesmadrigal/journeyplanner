		<p style="font-family: Arial Black, Gadget, sans-serif;">I am a relatively new self taught software developer. My point of focus is web services like this one to make people's lives easier and more enjoyable while doing the things they already do. In the software community it's widely accepted that we are a means of life quality embetterment in the form of making what was once redundant and inefficient, simple and efficient.  With life's general pace linearly positive, the means by which we get what we need/want must become equally quickly paced and readily accessible. As one of the more renowned python programmers, John Peters, puts it, complex but not complicated. We must strive to make our designs as complex as necessary, while maintaining attention to detail, yet presenting complexities in a widely usable way to maximize utility and achieve innovation. With software we are enabled to have a directly contributing hand in the innovations that make our world advance as a whole. We each have a part in the globally connected world we now know and love. Connectivity is key in this day in age, and we must stay connected to our fellow human's technological wants and needs as software developers. My goal is to have a life in software; developing, building, researching, and learning. For when I found software, I found my career.</p>
